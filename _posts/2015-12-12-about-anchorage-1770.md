The Anchorage has a 240 year history in the South Carolina Lowcountry. The owners Frank & Amy Lesesne,moved from Atlanta and opened the new 15 room boutique inn in the old manse in July of 2015\. Built in 1770, the completed renovations include 13 in suite bathrooms, a commercial kitchen, an elevator and a Top Deck. A cottage with 2 additional guest rooms accompanies the waterfront mansion in downtown historic Beaufort, SC. 

New York interior designer Michelle Prentice, created a look that is timeless and decorative objects with strong, clean lines. Award winning architect Cooter Ramsey kept the historical integrity of the building in tact while providing the luxury necessary for an authentic boutique experience. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/957eecd7-88bb-40af-af4f-1e3a72ada3f2.jpg)
